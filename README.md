Project during the Spring 2017 semester at Rutgers University, for the Numerical Analysis class. 
Interpolates an (n+1)^th order polynomial, generates the unique n^th order polynomial that interpolates the data.
Pn was original. Testing functions required extra code to be written to generate a random set of data from the parameters.
